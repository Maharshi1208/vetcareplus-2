# VetCare+ (Capstone)

Mono-repo: one branch (`main`) only.
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Infra: Docker Compose (Postgres, pgAdmin, MailHog)
- Frontend: React (Vite + TS + Tailwind) â€” handled by Shrirang
- QA/Docs: Yash (SRS, Test Strategy, RTM, Postman, Playwright, JMeter, ZAP)

How to work:
- Commit/PRs to `main` only (small commits, clear messages).
- No feature branches for this project (avoid merge pain).
